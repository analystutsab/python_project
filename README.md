**Roller Coaster Database Project**

Overview
The Roller Coaster Database Project is a comprehensive analysis of roller coaster data. It involves data cleaning, exploration, and visualization. Here are the key aspects of the project:

Data Exploration:
DataFrame Shape: The dataset contains a certain number of rows and columns.
head() and tail(): We examined the first and last few rows to understand the data structure.
Data Types (dtypes): Explored the data types of each column (e.g., numeric, categorical).
describe(): Calculated summary statistics (mean, min, max, etc.) for numerical columns.

Data Preparation:
Dropping Irrelevant Columns: Removed unnecessary columns that didn’t contribute to the analysis.
Identifying Duplicated Columns: Checked for duplicate columns to avoid redundancy.
Renaming Columns: Improved column names for clarity (e.g., renaming “freq” to “frequency”).

Feature Creation:
Created new features based on existing data (e.g., calculating speed-to-frequency ratio).
Data Quality Check:

Checking Null Values: Investigated missing data and decided how to handle it.
Data Visualization:

Histograms and KDE Plots: Visualized distributions of coaster features (e.g., height, speed).

Box Plots: Explored variability and outliers in coaster characteristics.
Comparing Speed vs. Frequency: Analyzed the relationship between speed and ride frequency.

Heatmap: Visualized correlations between coaster attributes.

Pair Plot: Explored pairwise relationships across multiple features.
Conclusion
The Roller Coaster Database Project provides valuable insights into coaster design, safety, and popularity. It serves as a useful resource for amusement park enthusiasts and researchers.
